    INTRODUCTION
    As every 4th class at the HTL Donaustadt, we went to Malta. One positive point is, we don’t have to go to host families, because there were no slots free. Instead, we went wo a 4-Star-Hotel, the Salini resort. We went from Monday 14th to Monday 24th. It was a great time, and we also did a lot of tours and saw many things.
    THE HOTEL
    The Hotel was a 4 Star Hotel. The Bedrooms had 4 Beds, a Bathroom with a Shower and a Toilet. There was also a terrace, which connected the rooms of all my classmates, so it was able to meet with your friends without leaving the hotel or even leaving the room to the floor. The food was quite alright, in the morning and evening, there were always buffets. In the morning there were always things like bacon, sausages, eggs, beans, bread and fries. In the evening there was daily a different meal, but it was always meat, noodles and things like that.  
    THE TRIPS
    We had 2 half day and one full day trip. The half day trips were to Valetta and Mdina and Rhabatt. Valetta is the capital city of Malta, and Mdina is the old capital city. We had also a great guide named May, and I’m shure she knew Queen Victoria and the founder of Valetta personally. At the full day trip, we first visited a glassblowing shop. After that we went to the golden bay, and in the end to a fishing village called Marsaxlokk. In Marsaxlokk we had lunch, and it was a great experience. 
    CONCLUSION
    The trip was a great experience, and I will remember it for the rest of my life. It was such a great time!
